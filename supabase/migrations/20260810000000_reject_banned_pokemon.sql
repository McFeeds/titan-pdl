-- REJECT BANNED POKEMON SERVER-SIDE
-- A banned pokemon (point_value = 0) is filtered out of every public UI
-- query, but that alone doesn't stop a crafted submitDraftPick/addFreeAgent
-- call from succeeding -- these RPCs are the actual authority, so they need
-- their own check. record_draft_pick (admin override) is intentionally left
-- unrestricted, same as its existing turn/ended bypass.
